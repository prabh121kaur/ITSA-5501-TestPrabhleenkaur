## GitHub Actions Workflow

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow named **DevOps Test**.  
The workflow runs automatically whenever a push is made to the `main` or `master` branch.  
It performs two steps:
- Checks out the repository code using `actions/checkout@v4`
- Prints a confirmation message to verify successful execution
